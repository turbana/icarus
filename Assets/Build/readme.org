* Controls:
- WASD to move, mouse to look
- Left click to interact
- Scroll wheel up/down can also be used with switches and dials

* Known issues
- The dials are buggy when using left clicked. Suggest using the mouse wheel instead.

* What can I do?
- Currently, you can jump to any of the major planets and our Moon. You can try jumping elsewhere, but it's buggy currently. Only the planets/moon have textures currently.
- You can use "Time controls" to speed up/slow down time.
- You can spawn new "bodies". These are just test satellites that will spawn around the player's ship. By default it creates 10,000 of them, but you can configure it for more/less at a time.
- You can look at the prototype map system and zoom in/out.

* What the HELL are all these numbers?
You can ignore them mostly, but here is what they mean. Eventually there will be an in game help system. Either a spiral binder or a laptop or something with all this in it to refer to.
- n :: mean motion
- M :: mean anomaly
- E :: eccentric anomaly
- b :: beta
- t :: theta
- KM :: radius in KM from center of parent
- s :: elapsed time (in seconds)
- P :: period (in seconds)
- e :: eccentricity
- a :: semi major axis
- I :: inclination
- AN :: argument of ascending node
  
* Okaaaay, but how do I jump to another planet?
Just hit the small red "JUMP" button! It's all set up for Mars by default. Use the computer to program the target body, use the keypad (and button) to set the other parameters. Try changing inclination (I) and then speed up time.

The "a" parameter has to do with the semi major axis. Think of an egg. The length of the egg is the semi major axis (the waist of the egg is the semi minor axis, but we won't worry about that). When the PR/KM switch is set to KM (kilometer) it means the "a" parameter is in kilometers. When the PR/KM switch is set to PR is means the "a" parameter is a multiplier of the parent's radius. So by default the orbit is programmed for 1.2 x (radius of mars). Try leaving the PR/KM switch set to PR and change "a" to 5.

* Dude. What. The. Hell?
I know, right?
